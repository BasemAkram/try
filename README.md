Choose model type: Classification, Regression, or Clustering

Data preview and row sampling

Comprehensive preprocessing tools:

Missing value imputation (Simple, KNN, Iterative)

Encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot Encoding)

Scaling (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler)

Outlier handling (Winsorization)

Feature transformations (Log, Power, Polynomial)

Feature selection and dimensionality reduction:

RFE with Random Forest

PCA

Machine learning models:

Classification: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression

Regression: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Linear Regression

Clustering: KMeans, Agglomerative, DBSCAN

Model evaluation with metrics and visualizations

Interactive data visualization (Line, Bar, Box, Scatter, Pie, Distribution plots)

Undo and reset functionality for each processing step

🔹 Technologies Used
